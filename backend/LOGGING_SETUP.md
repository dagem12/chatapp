# Backend Logging Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive logging system has been successfully implemented for the chat application backend using NestJS and Winston.

## What Was Added

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `winston` - Advanced logging library
- `nest-winston` - Winston integration for NestJS

### 2. Logging Infrastructure

#### Logger Module (`src/logger/logger.module.ts`)
- Winston configuration with multiple transports
- Console logging with colorized output
- File logging for errors (`logs/error.log`)
- Combined logging for all events (`logs/combined.log`)

#### Logger Service (`src/logger/logger.service.ts`)
- Custom logger service with specialized methods
- Request/response logging
- Database query logging
- Authentication event logging
- Message event logging

#### Middleware (`src/logger/middleware/logging.middleware.ts`)
- HTTP request/response logging
- Tracks method, URL, IP, user agent
- Measures response time
- Logs response status codes

#### Interceptors (`src/logger/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts`)
- Request/response interceptor
- Sanitizes sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
- Tracks user context and request details
- Measures execution time

#### Exception Filters (`src/logger/filters/logging-exception.filter.ts`)
- Global exception filter for error logging
- Captures full error context
- Logs stack traces and request details
- Provides structured error responses

### 3. Integration Points

#### Controllers Enhanced
- **AuthController**: Login, registration, profile operations
- **MessagesController**: Message CRUD operations
- **ConversationsController**: Conversation management
- **HealthController**: Health check endpoints

#### Services Enhanced
- **AuthService**: Authentication and user management
- **MessagesService**: Message and conversation operations
- **PrismaService**: Database connection management

#### Global Integration
- **main.ts**: Winston logger setup and global exception filter
- **app.module.ts**: Logger module, middleware, and interceptor registration

### 4. Log Files Created
- `logs/error.log` - Error-level logs only
- `logs/combined.log` - All log levels
- Console output - Colorized logs for development

### 5. Log Levels Used
- `error` - Error conditions and exceptions
- `warn` - Warning conditions (failed logins, validation errors)
- `info` - Informational messages (successful operations)
- `debug` - Debug-level messages (token validation)
- `verbose` - Verbose messages

## Features

### Request/Response Logging
- All HTTP requests and responses are logged
- Includes method, URL, status code, response time
- User context when available
- IP address and user agent tracking

### Authentication Logging
- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- Registration attempts
- Token validation
- Password changes
- Online status updates

### Message Operations Logging
- Message creation, updates, deletion
- Conversation creation and retrieval
- Message read status updates
- Participant management

### Database Operations Logging
- Database connection/disconnection events
- Query execution (when enabled)
- Health check results

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging with stack traces
- Request context preservation
- Structured error responses
- Security-sensitive data sanitization

## Configuration

The logging system is automatically configured and ready to use. Log files are created in the `logs/` directory and are already included in `.gitignore`.

## Usage

The logging system works automatically without any additional configuration needed. All controllers, services, and middleware are already integrated with the logging system.

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track all application activities
2. **Debugging Support**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
3. **Security Auditing**: Track authentication and authorization events
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking
5. **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging with context
6. **Production Ready**: File-based logging for production environments

## Next Steps

The logging system is now fully operational and will provide comprehensive visibility into the application's behavior, making debugging, monitoring, and maintenance much easier.
